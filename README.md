# alkalineElectrolyzer
This is an implementation of Ulleberg's Electrolyzer model,
and this repository includes two functions: **alkalineElectrolyzer** and ** alkalineEly**, 
which differ in the function input. The former function require **Power** to be inputed, while
the latter could handle **Current** input
